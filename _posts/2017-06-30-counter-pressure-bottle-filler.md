Kegging saves a lot of time and effort compared to bottling beer, however sometimes you
need to get carbonated beer out of a keg and into a bottle. Building a counter pressure
filler makes this easy. The basic principle is to fill a bottle with c02 at the same
pressure as the keg, connect the bottle to the beer side of the keg, gradually release 
the c02 to fill the bottle with beer and cap. Because the pressure in the bottle is the 
same as the keg there is very little foaming and minimal loss of carbonation.

![Simple Counter Pressure Filler](/img/bottle_filler/complete_assembly.jpg){:class="right"} I built a filler after 
reviewing a few designs and simplifying things wherever I could. The left hand side is
connected to my regulator and the right hand side to a picnic tap attached to the keg. The spike is inserted into
the bottle, the valve opened to fill with gas with finger over the needle, valve closed, picnic tap opened and gas
gradually released to fill the bottle with beer.

Parts list:
 - Bevlex 200 3/16 thick walled beer line
 - 3/8" outer diameter hard gas/beer line
 - Shut-off valve 3/8" pushfitting
 - 3/16 equal tee pushfitting
 - 17mm top diameter rubber stopper
 - 7mm outer diameter 25cm hollow steel tube (not sure where to get this, got some from a fellow brewer)
 - Needle
 
![Drilling the stopper](/img/bottle_filler/drill_stopper.jpg){:class="right"} Suppliers:
 - [Keg Solutions](http://www.kegsolutions.co.za/products)
 - [Specialised Dispense Systems](https://dispense.co.za/shop/brewmaster-38-od-clear/)
 - Lab/Science supply shop (stopper)
 - Pharmacy (needle)
 
The thick walled beer line is more expensive than the thin gas/beer line but more flexible making the filler and
bottle easier to handle. You could probably skip the steel tube and just use hard gas/beer line instead. It needs to
get within a couple of centimeters of the bottom of the bottle. The soft beer line fits over the hard stuff if you 
heat it up with boiling water. Likewise the hard beer line fits over the steel tube in the same way.

I drilled the stopper using 4mm, 5mm and 
then 6mm wood drill bits from the small side.

![Needle for gas release](/img/bottle_filler/needle.jpg){:class="right"} The needle needs to poke through the stopper
 to let gas out.

![Picnic tap attachment](/img/bottle_filler/picnic_tap.jpg){:class="right"} The hard beer line fits snugly into a
picnic tap.
